## Similarity
> Two geometrical objects are called similar if they both have the same shape, or one has the same shape as the mirror image of the other. More precisely, one can be obtained from the other by uniformly scaling (enlarging or reducing), possibly with additional translation, rotation and reflection. This means that either object can be rescaled, repositioned, and reflected, so as to coincide precisely with the other object. If two objects are similar, each is congruent to the result of a particular uniform scaling of the other.

## Similarity measure

> In statistics and related fields, a `similarity measure` or `similarity function` is a real-valued function that quantifies the similarity between two objects. Although no single definition of a `similarity measure` exists, usually such measures are in some sense the inverse of [distance metrics](): they take on large values for similar objects and either zero or a negative value for very dissimilar objects.

[Cosine similarity]() is a commonly used similarity measure for real-valued vectors, used in (among other fields) [information retrieval]() to score the similarity of documents in the [vector space model](). In machine learning, common [kernel functions]() such as the [RBF kernel]() can be viewed as similarity functions

## Similarity learning

> `Similarity learning` is an area of [supervised machine learning]() in [artificial intelligence](). It is closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in [ranking](), in [recommendation systems](), `visual identity tracking`, `face verification`, and `speaker verification`.

## Image similarity

> Image similarity involves fetching similar looking images given a reference image. Our solution called SimNet, is a deep siamese network which is trained on pairs of positive and negative images using a novel online pair mining strategy inspired by Curriculum learning. We also created a multi-scale CNN, where the final image embedding is a joint representation of top as well as lower layer embedding's. We go on to show that this multi-scale siamese network is better at capturing fine grained image similarities than traditional CNN's.
