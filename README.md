## Similarity
> Two geometrical objects are called similar if they both have the same shape, or one has the same shape as the mirror image of the other. More precisely, one can be obtained from the other by uniformly scaling (enlarging or reducing), possibly with additional translation, rotation and reflection. This means that either object can be rescaled, repositioned, and reflected, so as to coincide precisely with the other object. If two objects are similar, each is congruent to the result of a particular uniform scaling of the other.

##Image similarity

> Image similarity involves fetching similar looking images given a reference image. Our solution called SimNet, is a deep siamese network which is trained on pairs of positive and negative images using a novel online pair mining strategy inspired by Curriculum learning. We also created a multi-scale CNN, where the final image embedding is a joint representation of top as well as lower layer embedding's. We go on to show that this multi-scale siamese network is better at capturing fine grained image similarities than traditional CNN's.
